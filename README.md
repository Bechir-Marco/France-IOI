In every new chapter you will find a course to understand it's conecpts clearly before you use it in your problems. <br/>
Form level 3, you will learn  : Advanced operations on strings, Recursion, Sorting of complexity O(NÂ²)...  <br/>
in the next levels, it really starts to create computer science experts. This will allow you to understand advanced stuff like: <br/>
* Binary tree <br/>
* Graph theory <br/>
* Dynamic programming <br/>
